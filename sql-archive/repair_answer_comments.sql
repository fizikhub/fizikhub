-- REPAIR SCRIPT FOR ANSWER COMMENTS
-- This script safely fixes the table and policies by dropping old ones first.

-- 1. Create table if not exists
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS answer_comments (
    id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer_id BIGINT REFERENCES answers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
    author_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE answer_comments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Drop existing policies to avoid "already exists" error
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Comments are viewable by everyone" ON answer_comments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can comment" ON answer_comments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own comments" ON answer_comments;

-- 4. Re-create policies
CREATE POLICY "Comments are viewable by everyone" 
ON answer_comments FOR SELECT 
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can comment" 
ON answer_comments FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = author_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own comments" 
ON answer_comments FOR DELETE 
USING (auth.uid() = author_id);

-- 5. Grant permissions
GRANT ALL ON answer_comments TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON answer_comments TO anon;

-- 6. Add to realtime (ignore error if already added)
DO $$
BEGIN
  ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE answer_comments;
EXCEPTION WHEN duplicate_object THEN
  NULL;
END $$;
